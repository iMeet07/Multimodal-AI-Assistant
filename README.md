# Multimodal-AI-Assistant
 Multimodal AI Assistant is a high-performance, locally deployed intelligent assistant designed to seamlessly interact with large language models, structured files, and multimodal inputs. Built on the Chainlit framework, the system leverages LangChain orchestration and ChatOllama to host and execute LLMs entirely on-device, ensuring low-latency responses, enhanced privacy, and offline capability. The platform supports multimodal reasoning across text and file inputs, while integrating LiteralAI for cloud-based observability, usage analytics, and performance monitoring. Engineered with a modular, extensible architecture, the assistant enables scalable experimentation with local LLM workflows and production-grade AI interactions.
